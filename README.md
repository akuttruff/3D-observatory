# 3D-observatory
A fun side project to help my friend build a space website while she's home from school during pandemic times. We're going to keep this as simple as possible by directly copying the [Three JS](https://threejs.org/) code into a directory, so that we don't get side-tracked with bundlers and package managers.

Big thanks to [this CodePen](https://codepen.io/Octavector/pen/hxcmF) by Octavector, which I've used as a springboard for the initial ThreeJS confirguration and camera settings.
