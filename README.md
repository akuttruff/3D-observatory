# 3D-observatory
A fun side project to help my friend build a space website while she's home from school during pandemic times. We're going to keep this as simple as possible by directly copying the [Three JS](https://threejs.org/) code into our `/js
` directory, so that we don't get side-tracked with bundlers and package managers.

We run this locally with [Python's SimpleHTTPServer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/set_up_a_local_testing_server#Running_a_simple_local_HTTP_server) from our terminal by typing:

 ```python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000```

We can then open our web browser and navigate to `localhost:8000` to see our app.

Thanks to [this CodePen](https://codepen.io/Octavector/pen/hxcmF) by Octavector, which I've used as a springboard for the initial ThreeJS confirguration and camera settings.
